MONTE CARLO PATH INTEGRALS AND INSTANTONS.

Scheme.

INTRODUCTION: Discussion about Instantons (so euclidean PI) and Tunneling events in quantum mechanics (euclidean PI)
using the toy example of the double well.


EXACT DIAGONALIZATION: Reference problem. solve the schroedinger problem for the double well potential using HO eigenstates. 
Used to compare results in monte carlo.

MONTE CARLO ON EUCLIDEAN LATTICE: use metropolis algorithm to compute partition functions and Free Energy (adiabatic technique).
Compare with the previous results (this is worse than the exact but useful when more dimensions). 

COOLING METHOD: method that allow to get the instanton density (tunneling rate) 
but we lose information on the correlation functions, since we are neglecting quantum fluctuations.

HEATING METHOD: opposite method. Allow to compute correlation functions starting from a classical ensemble 
of non interacting instantons (Random Gas) and we perturb with Gaussian potential.
Notice about the result: CF are not precise because one should consider interactions and non gaussian effects (Liquid Model).
